		<h2>What is Naan?</h2>
		<p>Naan (pronounced nahn) is an oven-baked, leavened bread that is stuffed and flavored in a variety of ways. An essential part of South and Central Asian cuisine, naan is easy, affordable, and makes the most of pantry ingredients you already have on hand.</p>
		<p>Flour, yeast, milk, and butter make a tender dough that's simply seasoned with garlic and salt, but there is a wide array of naan bread flavors. You'll find everything from coconut and raisin-stuffed bread to saucy lamb-topped naan in restaurants and home kitchens around the world.</p>
		<h2>How to make Naan?</h2>
		<p>Making delightfully soft homemade naan is easier than you think. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:</p>
		<p>Start by making an easy egg-enriched yeast dough, then let it rise for one hour. Next, punch the dough down and knead in minced garlic or other desired fillings before letting it rise a second time. Cook the naan dough on a grill pan over high heat until golden brown and puffy.</p>
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
			<li>1 cup warm water</li>
			<li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
			<li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
			<li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
			<li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Direction</h2>
		<h3>Step 1</h3>
		<p>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</p>
		<h3>Step 2</h3>
		<p>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</p>
		<h3>Step 3</h3>
		<p>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</p>
		<h3>Step 4</h3>
		<p>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</p>
		<h3>Step 5</h3>
		<p>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</p>
		<h3>Step 6</h3>
		<p>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</p>
		<h3>Step 7</h3>
		<p>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</p>
		<h3>Step 8</h3>
		<p>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle</p>
		<h3>Step 9</h3>
		<p>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan</p>
		<h3>Step 10</h3>
		<p>Enjoy!</p>
